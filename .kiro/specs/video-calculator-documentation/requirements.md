# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Video File Size Calculator, a professional-grade web application designed for the media industry. The application provides accurate file size calculations for various video codecs, resolutions, frame rates, and durations, with a comprehensive admin interface for managing codec data and system configuration.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a media professional, I want to calculate video file sizes for different codec configurations, so that I can plan storage requirements and workflow decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a codec category THEN the system SHALL display available codecs for that category AND automatically calculate results if all fields are complete
2. WHEN a user selects a codec THEN the system SHALL display available variants for that codec AND automatically calculate results if all fields are complete
3. WHEN a user selects a variant THEN the system SHALL display supported resolutions for that variant AND automatically calculate results if all fields are complete
4. WHEN a user selects a resolution THEN the system SHALL display supported frame rates for that resolution AND automatically calculate results if all fields are complete
5. WHEN a user selects a frame rate THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate and display file size results
6. WHEN a user enters duration (hours, minutes, seconds) THEN the system SHALL validate the input is positive AND automatically recalculate results
7. WHEN all required fields are selected THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate and display file size in MB, GB, and TB without requiring manual submission
8. WHEN calculation parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a media professional, I want to use preset configurations for common workflows, so that I can quickly calculate file sizes for standard scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display default workflow presets loaded from Firebase Firestore with localStorage fallback

4. WHEN a user creates a new preset THEN the system SHALL add it to the preset list in local storage
5. WHEN a user deletes a preset THEN the system SHALL remove it from the local preset list
6. WHEN a user resets presets THEN the system SHALL restore default presets from Firebase or fallback to hardcoded defaults
7. WHEN Firebase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL load default presets from localStorage cache
8. WHEN user has custom presets in localStorage THEN the system SHALL prioritize those over Firebase defaults

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a media professional, I want to share calculation configurations with colleagues, so that we can collaborate on project planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has configured a calculation THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable URL
2. WHEN a user clicks the share button THEN the system SHALL copy the URL to clipboard
3. WHEN a user accesses a shared URL THEN the system SHALL load the shared configuration
4. WHEN URL parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL use default values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage the codec database through a secure admin interface, so that I can keep codec data current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL require Google OAuth authentication
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL verify the user email is in the authorized admin list
3. WHEN an unauthorized user attempts access THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an error message
4. WHEN an admin is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display admin interface with codec management capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage codec data in Firebase Firestore, so that all users have access to the latest codec information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL fetch codec data from Firebase Firestore
2. WHEN Firebase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use cached local data as fallback
3. WHEN an admin updates codec data THEN the system SHALL save changes to Firebase
4. WHEN codec data is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the local cache
5. WHEN Firebase connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
6. WHEN an admin views codec management THEN the system SHALL display individual codec configurations with edit capabilities
7. WHEN an admin edits a codec configuration THEN the system SHALL update the specific codec in Firestore
8. WHEN an admin adds a new codec configuration THEN the system SHALL create the codec in Firestore
9. WHEN an admin deletes a codec configuration THEN the system SHALL remove the codec from Firestore
10. WHEN codec changes are saved THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect updates in the user interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to export and import codec database, so that I can backup data and update the system with new codec information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin clicks export THEN the system SHALL generate a complete JSON export of the codec database
2. WHEN an admin imports a file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure
3. WHEN import validation passes THEN the system SHALL show a preview of changes before applying
4. WHEN an admin confirms import THEN the system SHALL update the Firebase database
5. WHEN import fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage default presets in Firebase Firestore, so that users have centrally-managed workflow configurations available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses preset management THEN the system SHALL display current default presets stored in Firebase Firestore
2. WHEN an admin modifies a default preset THEN the system SHALL update the preset configuration in Firebase Firestore
3. WHEN an admin adds a new default preset THEN the system SHALL save it to Firebase Firestore and make it available to all users
4. WHEN an admin deletes a default preset THEN the system SHALL remove it from Firebase Firestore and user interfaces
5. WHEN default presets are updated in Firebase THEN the system SHALL load the updated presets for new users
6. WHEN Firebase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to localStorage cached default presets
7. WHEN a user has no custom presets THEN the system SHALL load default presets from Firebase Firestore
8. WHEN a user has custom presets in localStorage THEN the system SHALL prioritize user presets over Firebase defaults
9. WHEN Firebase default presets are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the cache for users without custom presets

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Google Analytics tracking, so that I can monitor application usage and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria
