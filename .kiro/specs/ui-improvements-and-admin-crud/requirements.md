# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the user experience by removing unnecessary UI elements and enhancing the admin interface with full CRUD operations for codec variants. The changes include removing the calculate button from the main UI since calculations are automatic, and implementing comprehensive codec variant management in the admin interface with Firestore persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the calculator, I want the interface to be cleaner without unnecessary buttons, so that I can focus on the calculation inputs without visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculator interface loads THEN the system SHALL NOT display a calculate button
2. WHEN input values change THEN the system SHALL automatically perform calculations without requiring user action
3. WHEN the calculate button is removed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing calculation functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to perform full CRUD operations on codec variants, so that I can manage the complete codec database including all variant configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin interface THEN the system SHALL display all codec variants for each codec
2. WHEN creating a new codec variant THEN the system SHALL save the variant to Firestore and update the local state
3. WHEN editing an existing codec variant THEN the system SHALL update the variant in Firestore and reflect changes locally
4. WHEN deleting a codec variant THEN the system SHALL remove the variant from Firestore and update the local display
5. IF a codec variant operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. WHEN codec variant changes are made THEN the system SHALL persist all changes to the central Firestore datastore

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the codec variant management to be intuitive and consistent with existing admin patterns, so that I can efficiently manage the codec database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing codec variants THEN the system SHALL display them in an organized, readable format
2. WHEN performing CRUD operations on variants THEN the system SHALL use consistent UI patterns with existing admin functionality
3. WHEN managing codec variants THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback for all operations
4. WHEN errors occur during variant operations THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages
